SETTING THE STAGE\nThe nationaleducationreformmovementinthe USA (US), whichis usedhereasanexample ofa highly developed\ncountry, has not delivered the results envisioned or hoped for when it was launched by A Nation at Risk (National\nComission on Excellence in Education, 1983). Rather than rising levels of national student achievement to meet the\nneedsofthe21stcentury,theUSreformmovementhasinsteadyieldedagrowingburdenofresponsibilitiesbeingpiled\nupon local educators. Current attempts focused on improving student performance have not resulted in significant\ngains on standardized tests or on graduation rates, especially for the students who traditionally perform poorly.\nSince A Nation at Risk there has been an increasing crescendo of calls for reform in the US. Yet accompanying\neachdecade ofreformhavebeen numerousreports continuing to document the failures ofthe nation’s schools. There\nhas been an endless progressionof fads sweeping through the US schools, eachbuoyed by inflated claims of its power\nto reshape education for the better. One novelty follows another, typically leaving only broken promises and dashed\nhopes behind. The parade of failed pseudo-innovations leaves educators and their communities pessimistic about the\nvalue of anything new proposed by state or national decision-makers. They are fearful that any new developments\nand initiatives will again be temporary – here today and gone, if not tomorrow, then in a year or two – eliminated\nbecause of lack of commitment or lack of resources or both.\nChanging priorities, overlapping as well as conflicting educational targets of achievement and well intentioned\nbut poorly structured local, state, and national programs have produced an ineffective, inefficient, and increasingly\nirrelevant education system. As one looks across the current educational scene it is possible to identify a continuum\nofinitiativesthatcanbeobservedinmostUSschools. Thiscontinuumismadeupofatleastthreegeneralcategories:\nchaos, revitalization, and the beginnings of a transformation. Some characteristics of each are summarized below.\nA. Chaos\nThe first category of the continuum, “chaos,” embraces most reforms entering classrooms from “the outside”.\nThese initiatives may be mandated by politicians, regulators, education administrators, or well-meaning reformers.\nFor example, the initiatives in the US in mathematics, English and science for quasi national standards are creating\ndilemmas for school districts. Questions being raised include: How do we disseminate the standards? How can we\nprepareenoughteachersquicklyenoughtoteachthenewstandards? Whatsortofpedagogywillbemosteffectiveand2\nhow to implement it? How can teachers prepare their students for the tests that are to measure student learning of\nthe new standards? Howdo weevaluate teachereffectiveness ifwedo notusethe typicalvalue-addedmeasurements?\nThe reforms have not only sparked chaos in local schools but have actually been counterproductive. They have left\nparents, local policymakers, and especially teachers leery of investing in new ideas because the likelihood of failure is\nfar greater than of success. Those who recognize the chaos get discouraged and stop fighting it.\nMeanwhile, newcomers keep emerging certain that the problems of schools are easily solved and they jump in to\nstarta new roundofunrealistic reforms. No one knowswhat shouldreplace the currentpoorly functioning systemor\nhowtophaseinareplacementsuchthatgenuineimprovementtakesplacedespitetheinnumerablebarriers. Typically\nthese new reforms do not result in sustained student achievement.

As Michael Fullan (2007) states “It has become more\nobviousthattheapproachesthathavebeenusedsofartobringabouteducationalchangearenotworkingandcannot\nwork” (p. 299).\nB. Revitalization\nButwhileexternalreformsarebeinginflictedonschoolsandteachers,manyeducatorsatthelocallevelarecreating\na second kind of intervention. They are creating their own innovations to solve the problems they have identified\nas most pressing in their individual schools and classrooms. The innovations are “revitalization” reforms and have\nbeen implemented by the people who created them to meet a personal need locally. They may be limited to a single\nclassroomwhenateacherdiscoversthemosteffectivewaytoengagethestudentstechniquesthatmayhavebeengained\nthroughparticipationinworkshops,collaborativeconversationswithotherteachers,ortrialanderrorintheclassroom.\nLocal initiatives demonstrate enough success to energize and revitalize local attempts to improve education, even in\nthefaceofreformsimposedbyoutsideauthorities. However,thesereformstypicallyresultinincrementalchangesand\nare rarely recognized or widespread. Furthermore, there is typically little research to demonstrate just what makes\nthem successful.\nThere are also some revitalizationreforms that are more widespreadthan a single classroom. They may have been\ntheresultofstateornationallyfundedreformsthathavedemonstratedsuccessinnumbersofschools,evennationally.\nAlthough these reforms in schools may not always demonstrate the integrity of the original design, they have had\nstaying power because of the engagement by committed programdevelopers and teachers. Examples of such reforms\nintheUSinclude: SuccessforAll(Slavin,2011,2014),ReadingRecovery(Clay,1993,2005;LyonsandPinnell,2001),\nPhysics by Inquiry (McDermott and the Physics Education Group, 1995), Cooperative Learning (Johnson, Johnson\nand Holubec. 1994; Johnson and Johnson, 2014), National Writing Project (National Writing Project, 2014), and\nProjectLeadthe Way (PLTW) (2014). However,many of these reforms rarely surpass inclusionin more than a 1000\nof the hundred thousand schools in the US, and even with their limited expansion there is little to ensure integrity\nwiththeiroriginaldesign. However,suchreformsdoprovideteachersandschoolstheopportunitytoinstitutechanges\nin classroom structure and instruction that could lead to more student engagement.\nC. Transformation\nAs locally effective as school or district revitalization reforms may be, they typically are not able to effect state\nor national change. There need to be sustainable, scalable interventions that enable improvements in learning for\nall students. Such interventions can be referred to as “transformations” and imply new kinds of structures and\nstandards of performance. Exceptional revitalization innovations currently found in individual teacher’s classrooms,\nin schools led by exceptional principals, and in districts led by exceptional superintendents (our use of the American\nnomenclature is not important here) may offer promising ideas for transformation. Bold experiments are called for\n“that generate new and powerful forces, including, for example, teachers energies and commitments unleashed by\naltered working conditions and new collective capacities, and students’ intellectual labor in collaborating with other\nstudentstodotheworkoflearning”(Fullan,2007,p.299). However,theseneedtobeintegratedwithotherinnovations\ninordertohavewidespreadimpact. Withtime,educationaltransformationcouldbeacceleratedtospreadoverentire\ncountries and internationally through competition among innovations.\nAlthough the details of the classification are tentative and incomplete, it offers some guidelines for assessing pro-\ngrams. It would be desirable to reduce unproductive activities of the kind listed under chaos and make progress3\ntowards transformation. For example several of the “given” traditional ways for schooling in the US are only his-\ntorically contingent patterns from the beginnings of the 20th century, which currently could be challenged. These\npatterns include: the mandate for twelve years in school, the selection and arrangement of the curriculum, and the\nacademic credit system. Sheppard (2005)specifically points out that the academic credit system became antithetical\nto the ideas of progressive education as it expanded beyond the administrative and logistical issues for which it was\ndesigned. These and other historically contingent patterns that are no longer productive for the 21st century should\nbe open to challenge. However, recognizing that transformations may take many years, shorter-term (three to five\nyears) improvements in education are possible with support for revitalization programs across more schools.\nD. Towards Harmony\nThe current focus for both, national, state or regional funding is on expanded rigorous testing to determine the\ndegree of success in teaching. Unfortunately, what teachers have long known, what gets tested is what gets taught.\nIt does not matter whether the material is actually preparing students for careers or higher education or a fulfilling\nlife. For example, as noted in a 2012 Ohio newspaper the emphasis has been on “test scores above learning, ratings\nabove reasoning, and appearances above academics.” The editorial asks “Is that the best plan we have to develop\nstudents who are prepared to succeed in a complicated, competitive global society?” (Cincinnati Enquirer, 2012).\nAnd paraphrasing W. Edwards Deming, “...quality can’t be achieved through inspection and sorting out defectives,\nbut rather by improving the process...” (Lillrank, 2010).\nConfidenceintheabilitytoactuallyreformeducationcontinuestoerode. Partoftheproblemisthatoureducation\nsystems are complex and messy. The attempts that have been made to understand those isolated pockets of success\nthat are always selected as examples of what can be accomplished have never been able to account for the inability\nto bring these to a scale beyond a few thousand schools. The names may stay but the students rarely experience the\nsuccess of the original model (Education Trust, 1998,1999; Grissmer and Flanagan, 1998).\nResearch on what impacts student performance continues to be ambiguous. There are significant variations in\nresearchdesign,problemswithestablishingcontrolgroups,andlackofclarityofhowteacherpreparationandstudent\nachievement and performance are defined. And there is little researchon the interactions of the many variables that\nimpact the delivery of quality teaching and learning. There is also a lack of historical research on the continuity and\nchange that has impacted education.\nAnewparadigmisneededbasedontheestablishmentofprinciplesforlearningandrulesforteachingasetofexplicit\nprinciples that govern the processes of learning and rules that serve as a norm for guiding the process of teaching.\nThese rules and principles are not susceptible to arbitrary decisions and are increasingly recognized as flowing from\nand incorporating how the brain develops and learns as the product of millions of years of evolution (Fields, 2010;\nGladwell, 2008; Dawkins, 2004) and how it can operate most recently in a free society (Dewey, 1997). Some of\nthese principles and rules must support the freedom of all students to learn the way they are capable of learning,\nhelp students realize what this means in terms of personal freedom and individual responsibility, and safeguard the\nfreedom to choose, prevent abuses, and respond to changing contexts.\nThe new paradigmofErgonomicEducationproposedbelowwouldallowformanycompeting ideas to fuelstudents\nwanting to learn. However, these ideas will only be in harmony as long as there is agreement on the principles of\nlearningandrulesofproductiveteachingstudied,recognized,developedandappliedbytheteachers.

HISTORY CEO\nTomostpeoplehistoryconsistsofdatesandrecordsofeventsandindividuals–awar,anelection,acoup,thebirth,\nlife anddeathof notable personae,and morerecently,the lives andcontexts ofthe generalpopulation. Incontrastto\ntheemphasesonspecificdatesandevents,individualsorpopulations,ongoing processes of changethroughouthistory,\nhave had far more profound impacts on people’s daily lives than do most isolated historical events.\nHistorians understand that “the unique and the specific matter as much as the universal; that context and initial\nconditionsmatter;thattheworldismorecomplexthanwhatisassumedinvariable-controlledlaboratoryexperiments;4\nand that predictions are at best problematic” (Staley, 2010, p. 35). However, although messy complexities and\nidiosyncrasiescharacterizethe study of history, it is still possible to draw inferences that illuminate useful knowledge\n(Landes, Molkyr and Baumol, 2012, p. 528).\nSimilaritiesandcommonalitiesindevelopmentcanbeobservedinthemidstofthedifferencesthatseparatehistorical\nevents. These similarities and commonalities can aid in establishing categories and analogies that provide structure\nfor understanding the flow of history. This flow of history encompasses processes of change over extended periods of\ntime. A perspective on the more profound of the ongoing processes of change that have had and continue to have\nsignificantimpactsarereflectedinthephrase: “HistoryCEO”HistoryConstrains,EnablesandOrganizes. Significant\nchangeprocessesthatspancenturiescanbeidentifiedandhaveimplicationsforthefuture. Understandingthedriving\nforces and trajectories of these change processes may help society be better prepared to meet the challenges of the\n21stcentury. EachchangeprocessofHistoryCEO,“inandofitselfisindeterminate,alwayscontingentonnumerous\nfactors and usually compatible with movement in diverse directions” (Eisenstein, 2005, p. 333). One notable and\nexceptional example of such diverse paths is the contrast b etween the impact of the printing press and printing in\nChina compared to the impact in Western Europe, particularly in education, over centuries.\nMore than1300yearsagoChina developedandusedprinting ona largescale,but only for a limited time. Initially\nprinting was oriented to religious materials and was encouragedby a woman, a prominent supporter who became an\nempress. Religious beliefs embraced by the empress enabled the spread of printing. However, soon after her death,\nprinting declined and the process was ignored for two centuries. According to Barrett (2008) “Sheer misogyny was\nundoubtedlyafactorinthis,but,dynasticpolitics,religiousrivalries,vestedscribalinterests,elitesnobbery,andeven\na whiff of xenophobia also played a part to a greater and lesser degree” (Introduction and Acknowledgements). All\nthese conspired to constrain the spread of printing, despite the initial enabling by the empress.\nIn contrast to the history of printing in China, Elizabeth Eisenstein (1980) in her two volume ground-breaking\nhistory of printing in early Western Europe has identified a systematic, centuries-long, change and growth for what\nshe has called “the print culture”. Significant and irreversible changes were brought about in Europe following the\n“invention” of the printing press by Gutenberg (c 1450).\nIn her book The Printing Press as an Agent of Change: Communications and Cultural Change in Early-Modern\nEurope (Eisenstein, 1983), Eisenstein explains the now-forgotten constraints that were faced by people who had to\nmake do with the oral and scribal culture that existed prior to the introduction of printing. Because books were\nvery scarce, most individuals were “constrained” from gaining knowledge from documented sources of that time.\nLibraries, which were the repository of written materials, were few and literally geographically out of the range of\nmost individuals. Furthermore, the scribal copying process led to repeated and newly introduced inaccuracies over\ntime.\nAsprintedbooksbecamemoreaccessible,theyenabledtheflowofinformationandthemorerapidorganizationand\nduplication of data. Multiple copies with identical content were more easily produced, eliminating unending hours of\nlabor and concentrationrequired by scribal copying. The use of books inspired an increasingly widespread variety of\nactivities not possible or even imagined prior to the existence of the printing press. However, it took more than a\ncentury and a half after Gutenberg’s first publication of Bibles for a “print culture” to emerge (Eisenstein, 2005).\nThe centuries-long build-up of activities associated with books both enabled and organized an increasingly diverse\nrange of applications. Eisenstein’s examples of advances in print communications led to changes in religious cultures\nand significant developments in early science, especially astronomy. The proliferation of books also resulted in a\nparadox of censorship. Banning certain books constrained the dissemination of ideas (particularly those viewed as\nthreatening to religious canon) in some quarters while simultaneously enabling the printing of those same books in\nother quarters specifically so that the controversialideas could be further examined (Eisenstein, 2005, pp. 209-285).\nAlthough Eisenstein comments that there was undoubtedly an impact on thinking and learning as books became\n“silent instructors,” carrying their message farther than any public lecture, she does not examine the “print culture”\nthatbecameembeddedineducation. Furthermoremosteducatorstodaydonotrecognizetheconsiderablesignificance\nof the centuries-long impact of the printing press and printing on the history of education.\nIn 1657, two centuries after Gutenberg introduced the printing press, John Amos Comenius, a Czech Moravian\nteacher,educator,andwritercompletedhisDidactica Magna(The Great Didactic, 1657,originallypublishedinLatin\ninAmsterdam)“settingforththewholeartofteachingallthingstoallmen”(Comenius,1992,CoverandTitle Page).\nHis book advocateduniversaleducation for both boys and girls,teaching in the vernacular,the use of textbooks, the\ndevelopment of graded schools, pacing of instruction, and specific roles for universities.5\nInChapterXXXIIComenius(1992)introducesthe“universalandmostperfectorderofinstruction”(pp. 287-294).\nAfter a brief introduction to the process of printing, Section 5 of the chapter provides analogies of teaching to the\nprinting press where “we might adapt the term typography’ and call the new method of teaching ‘didachography’ ”\n(p. 289). He goes on further to describe the following:\n“Pursuingthis analogy to the art of printing, we will show, by a more detailed comparison,\nthe true nature of this new method of ours, since it will be made evident that knowledge\ncan be impressed on the mind, in the same way that it’s concrete form can be printed on\npaper” (p. 289).\n“Instead of paper we have pupils whose minds have to be impressed with the symbols of\nknowledge. Instead of type we have the class books and the rest of the apparatus devised\nto facilitate the operation of teaching. The ink is replaced by the voice of the master, since\nthis is what conveysinformation fromthe books to the mind of the listener; while the press\nis schooldiscipline, which keeps the pupils up to their work andcompels them to learn”(p.\n289).\nComenius continues his analogy of comparing students to paper that is properly prepared and pressed using ink:\n“Similarly, the teacher, after he has explained a construction and has shown by examples\nhoweasilyitcanbe imitated, asksindividualpupils toreproducewhathehassaidandthus\nshow that they are not merely learners, but actually possessors of knowledge” (p. 293).\nSection 26 includes discussion of end of year examinations which were to be graded by inspectors. These ex-\naminations were necessary to test the students’ knowledge ensuring that the “subjects had been properly learned”\n(Comenius, 1992,p. 293). In 1658,Comenius published Orbis Pictus or Orbis Sensualium Pictus (The Visible World\nin Pictures) (Comenius, 1887). Each page has an image illustrating something having to do with the natural world\nsuch as botany, biology, zoology, religion, human activities. Accompanying each image are descriptors written in the\nvernacular (German) and Latin. Orbis Pictus became a popular children’s textbook and the model for classroom\ninstruction and was translated into many Western European languages by the 1700’s.\nBy the mid-19th century Comenius’ model of education and instruction had been adopted by most of Europe and\nthe US. It provided a uniform structure that could address the increasing need of educating more and more children\nwith fewer teachers per pupil, providing common materials and common curricula across a nation’s cultures. It also\nmet the workplace needs of the technological and manufacturing expansion of the industrial revolution.\nIn 1892, on the three-hundredth anniversary of Comenius’ birth, there were many celebrations of his work in the\nUS. In the National Education Association Proceedings for 1893 there were several essays noting Comenius’ impact:\n“WehavefoundinComeniusthesourceandtheforecastingofmuchthatinspiresanddirects\noureducationnow.Whatiscommonplacetodaywasgeniusthreehundredyearsago”(Hark,\n1893,p. 723).\n“TheplaceofComeniusinthe historyofeducation,therefore,isoneofcommandingimpor-\ntance. He introduces the whole modern movement in the field of elementary and secondary\neducation. His relation to our present teaching is similar to that held by Copernicus and\nNewtontowardmodernscience,andBaconandDescartestowardmodernphilosophy”(But-\nler, 1893, p. 728).\nAs the histories of the adoption of Comenius’ vision for schooling systems globally are examined, commonalities\nare expected that illustrate when history constrained, enabled or organized these systems.\nToday,121yearssincethecelebrationsin1892,mosteducationsystemsandmodesofinstructionarestillembedded\ninthe printculture of1657.

The\ntechnologyoftheinternethasfaroutpacedtheprintedtextbookasameansforsharinginformationandgainingstatic\nknowledge. And measures of performance are inadequate and require development. We believe the new paradigm\nof Ergonomic Education will refocus efforts on more productive teaching and learning by taking into account in a\nfundamental way the reasons humans want to learn and how they benefit from learning. The section, Why e to\nE, expands on the importance of changing the current educational paradigm to meet the demands of today and be\nprepared to adapt to the demands of the future.6\nThe focus on the print culture illustrates both a paradigm shift that occurred from the scribal culture to the print\nculture and the persistence of an education culture that has been immune from widespread significant change. In\ncontrast, science, technology, and business are conducted very differently today compared to the 1600’s. What can\nbe learned from the constraining, enabling, and organizing principles that have impacted their histories? How might\nthese examples contribute to understanding the challenges of education reform?\nFor example George E. Smith (2009), a historian of science and a philosopher of science, has placed on-line,\nhttp://www.stanford.edu/dept/cisst/visitors.html,“TestingNewtoniangravitythenandnow.” The materialreviews\nthe historical process of over three centuries of testing and simultaneous refinement of calculations in Newtonian\ngravity as it applies to the solar system. He documents the increasing variety of sources of gravitational potentials\nthathavebeenincluded,fromadditionalobjectsdiscoveredinthesolarsystemtolaterEinstein’scorrectionsrequired\nbyspecialandgeneralrelativity. Butattentiontosuchlong-runninghistoricalprocessesastheemergenceoftheprint\nculture or the testing of Newtonian gravity still seems to be rare.\nThomas Hughes (1983), a historian of technology writes in Networks of Power about the expansion of the electric\npower system from small intercity lighting systems of the late 19th century to the regional networks of the 1930’s.\nHe identifies phases of (1) inventor-entrepreneur,(2) technology transfer, (3) system growth and reverse salients, (4)\nmomentum and contingencies, (5) evolving systems and planned new ones. These processes mirror the processes ex-\npressedbyourHistoryCEO.Hughesframeworkenableshimtocomparethedevelopmentoftheelectricpowersystems\ninthe United States,Germany,andEngland. The comparisonsalongwiththeir contextualpeculiaritiesillustrate the\ndifferences inresources,organizationalstructures,political climates,economicpractices,culturalpreferencesbetween\nregionsaswellasnations. The emphasisis onthe multifacetedcomplexityofsystemsandwhatimpacts changesover\ntime.\nLandes, Molkyr and Baumol (2012) edited The Invention of Enterprise: Entrepreneurship from Ancient\nMesopotamia to Modern Times. In contrast to many current books focusing on what could be called “how to be\nan entrepreneur,” Landes, Molkyr and Baumol wanted to study entrepreneurship and its relationship to economic\ngrowthfromhistoricalaccounts. In17chaptersthis book describesthe socio-technologicalculture inspecific periods.\nDespite variations due to context, commonalities in the development of entrepreneurship across the centuries could\nbe identified and provide useful knowledge that the editors believe have immediate applications (pp. 527-528).\nPeter F. Drucker (1985) also provides a historical account of entrepreneurship in his book Innovation and En-\ntrepreneurship. From an examination of both modern and historical inventions, including inventions of new organi-\nzational system structures, Drucker identifies seven sources of innovation (1) the unexpected; (2) incongruities; (3)\nprocess need; (4) industry and market structures; (5) demographics; (6) changes in perception; (7) new knowledge.\nHe has identified patterns that again have repeated themselves over time in a variety of contexts.\nRather than providing a historical narrative portraying chaotic and unpredictable interactions of many different\nindividualsandevents,alwaysinthecontextofaparticularhistoricalsetting,theabovetextssearchforpatternsthat\nmight be connected through space and time. They are particularly interested in patterns that will permit a better\nunderstanding of the evolution of historical events that are reflected in today’s environment. These patterns may\nconstrain,enable,and/ororganizecultures,technologies,politicalentities,etc. overcenturies. HistoryCEOattempts\ndistill these patterns in a way to help understand the predicaments of the current education system. Gaddis (2002)\nrecognizes the importance of patterns in history and of “fitting it all together” (pp.48-49). He does not explicitly\naddress long-running processes of change that could exist in the historical record. However, he introduces many\nmetaphors comparing how one does history to how one does scienceparticularly the historical sciences of astronomy,\ngeology, and paleontology – all of which deal with very long running processes of change.\nSignificant change processes spanning centuries and multiple disciplines can be identified. History CEO offers a\nvocabulary for categorizing these processes into a coherent framework. The framework is context dependent, has\nindependent and interdependent variables, is open to positive and negative (Constraining, Enabling, Organizing)\nfeedbackloops,andcanillustrate the continuityofthe changeprocesses. The problemsofeducationarebothcontent\nspecific and interdisciplinary, they are economic and social, and they have historical roots and result from the latest\nreforms. Comparisons of the processes that dominate the success or failure of socio-technological and socio-cultural\nsystems thus have the potential of providing insights into current education problems and ideas for transformation.\nHowever, time and expertise are needed to collect, analyze, and synthesize data. What to do in the meantime?\nWhere to begin? There are sufficient though limited examples of education successes that could provide the seeds\nof the new paradigm of Ergonomic Education. Engineers, specifically ergonomic/human factor engineers interested\nin education as a foundation of the structure and function of society could provide the impetus for a new approach\nfor understanding the most pressing problems of education. As problem solvers they have been trained to achieve7\nspecificresultsincomplexenvironmentswithavailableresources. Wouldtheybeabletoanalyzethenotableeducation\nsuccesses and failures and subsequently design and produce a transition process that would lead from the current\neducation system to the Ergonomic Education system of the future?\nIII. A ROLE FOR ENGINEERS\nInordertoaddressasystemsapproachtoeducationalreform,WilsonandBarsky(1999)proposedthatthesixroles\nof teacher, principal, student, district administrator, consultant, parent and the community, involved in educational\nchange as described by Fullan (1991), needed to be expanded. Wilson and Barsky described a role for engineering\nresearchbasedonananalysisofReadingRecovery(Reading RecoveryCouncilofNorthAmerica,2014). Unlike most\nreforms, Reading Recovery has been successful in the US for over a quarter century. It is an integrated system that\nhas maintained its integrity yet has so far not realized its scale-up potential. It was proposed that the introduction\nof engineering researchwouldbe able to reverseengineer the components contributing to Reading Recovery’ssuccess\nand introduce an R&D mindset that would lead to future expansion.\nScientists are concerned with understanding how the natural or biological worlds work, engineers are concerned\nwith problem-solving. Yet both of the disciplines share centuries of development contributing to the knowledge and\npractices of today. In contrast school improvement research only began a sustained build-up in the 1960’s (Fullan,\n1991) and school improvement/educationalreform appears intellectually fragmented and not systemic.\nThe evidence that an engineering research discipline could significantly impact education reform is based on the\nexperience with discipline-based research in the sciences, particularly physics (Arons, 1990; McDermott and the\nPhysics Education Group, 1996). The recent report by the National Research Council (2012), Discipline-Based\nEducation Research: Understanding and Improving Learning in Undergraduate Science and Engineering, emphasized\nthe need for this continuing research which complements the work in the cognitive sciences by introducing specific\nattention to the disciplines’ priorities, knowledges, worldviews and practices. It advocates the adoption of evidence-\nbasedteaching practicesto improvelearningoutcomes for undergraduatescience andengineering students. However,\nwhatconstitutesthe“evidence”dependsontheeducationparadigm. InorderfortheErgonomicEducationparadigm\ntoberealized,theremustbeevidencethatitismoresuccessfulthanthecurrentparadigmincreatinganenvironment\nof productive learning.\nTheengineeringdisciplinesarepoisedtoaccumulatetheevidencerequiredthroughtheirunderstandingofhistorical\nprecedents (e.g,. aircraft manufacturing: Vincenti, 1990; Newman and Vincenti, 2007), knowledge of design (e.g.,\naircraft evolution from the Wright Brothers to the Boeing 777 and Airbus: Vincenti, 1990; Perrow, 1999; Petroski,\n1996,2006),processesofchange(e.g.,failuresofdesignsinairtransport,bridgebuilding,nuclearpowerplants: Perrow,\n1999;Petroski,1996,2006);theroleofconstraints(Perrow,1999;Petroski,2006)andreverseengineering. Ergonomics\nand Human Factors Engineering in particular have “a unique combination of three fundamental characteristics:\n(1) they take a systems approach (2) they are design driven and (3) they focus on two closely related outcomes:\nperformance and well-being” (Dul, Bruder, Buckle, Carayon, Falzon, Marras, Wilson and van der Doeler, 2012, p.\n4). And they bring a “...holistic, human-centeredapproachto work systems designthat considersphysical,cognitive,\nsocial, organization, environmental and other relevant factors.” Karwowski (2005, p. 437). Karwowski goes on to\npointoutthatorganizationalergonomicsisconcernedwiththeoptimizationofsocio-technicalsystems,includingtheir\norganizationalstructures, policies and processes.\nOne can ask if the ergonomics/human factors engineering disciplines are willing and interested in accepting the\nchallenge of bringing about a transformation in education which could address the concerns raised by Dul, Bruder,\nBuckle,Carayon,Falzon,Marras,WilsonandvanderDoeler(2012)that“Humanfactors/ergonomics(HFE)hasgreat\npotentialtocontribute tothe designofallkindsofsystemswithpeople (worksystems,product/servicesystems), but\nfaces challenges in the readiness of its market and in the supply of high-quality applications” (Abstract). However,\nif the ergonomic engineeringsystem design were applied to change educationalsystems and showedsome promise for\novercoming the roadblocks inherent to Comenian design, ergonomics/human factors would certainly get a firm hold\nin broadly understood contemporary professional culture as a resource of great importance.\nIV. WHY e TO E\nThe issue of education in the 21st century was an important subject of the first STHESCA conference in Krakw\nin July 2011 (STHESCA, 2011). Preparations included a seminar also held in Krakw in November 2010 that served8\nthe purpose of defining a starting point for discussing the subject of science, technology, and higher education in\ncontemporarysociety(Glazek,2011). Theproposedstartingpointobtainedtheworkingtitle“e and E.”Lower-case,\norsmalle denotesthe contemporaryworld-widesystemofeducationrootedinthe designby Comeniusfromthe 17th\ncentury (Comenius, 1992). Upper-case, or big E denotes a system on a par with contemporary needs.\nThe table below gives examples of features of e that, in comparison with features of E, appear already outdated.\nBy the visible contrast, these examples also illustrate that improvement of e does not automatically lead to creation\nof E. An explanation of the entries in the table is provided below.\nTABLEI: ExamplesillustratingdifferencesbetweensystemseandE(Glazek,2011). Explanationsfortheentriesareprovided\nbelow item byitem.\nnr e E\n1 subject matter person\n2 curriculum context\n3 focus on student weaknesses focus on studentstrengths\n4 separation of values from subject natural connection of subject with values\n5 one-size-fits-all testing for grades individualized informative assessment\n6 passing exams performance\n7 Comenian system post-Comenian system\n8 lack of accountability for learning accountability for learning `a la RR\n9 teaching according to age individualized teaching, life-long\n10 noself-correction system systematic self-correction system\n11 compulsion one’s will\n12 out of focus life-long brain development\n13 out of focus ten thousand hours\n1. System e is focused on teaching subject matter, whereas E is focused on educating a person in the context of\na subject.\n2. In e, the dominant form of teaching is specified by a curriculum independently of the context of students’ lives.\nIn E, a context important to students is a natural stimulus for learning important concepts.\n3. In e, students are punished if they do not know, do not understand, or cannot do something, until they fulfill\ntherequirements,evenifonlysuperficially. InE,students improveuponwhatthey aregoodat,andthisis how\nthey notice new elements and directions worth studying.\n4. In e, teaching subject matter is disconnected from teaching values and building character. Natural sharing of\nuseful information about the world among people in a group in E replaces destructive competition (Bok, 1987)\nand teaches principles of understanding in making decisions and handling resources.\n5. One-size-fits-all testing for grades in e is replaced in E by providing feedback regarding individual progress in\nskill acquisition.\n6. Testing of short-termmemorizing “to get credit” in e is replacedin E by assessmentof student performance in\npractice, akin to how skills of all other members of the system E are assessed (Drucker and Maciariello, 2008).\n7. Comenius designed the process of teaching students in e as analogous to printing books in a press, while E\nfulfills contemporary requirements (Drucker, 1993).\n8. Reading Recovery (Reading Recovery Council of North America, 2014) has a system for monitoring teachers’\nwork in terms of their students’ progressin acquiring skills. This is worth studying as a candidate for use in E;\nthere is no such system in e (Kenneth G. Wilson, personal communication).\n9. e functions like a production line ordered according to age, while E accounts for differences among students,\nenabling them to develop over the lifespan (Drucker, 1993).\n10. e becomes outdated andfails,having no systemofself-correction,while E is by definitionbeing createdso that\nit changes in agreement with the needs of its clients (Wilson and Daviss, 1994; Wilson and Barsky, 1998).9\n11. e is based on compulsion, and E on students’ will to learn (Glazek and Sarason, 2006) in agreement with the\nhypothesis(Glazek,2008)thatprocessesoflearningbasedonwillarethosethatleadtotruelearning,associated\nwith changes in structure and functioning of the brain and other body parts.\n12. Ine,the humanbrainistreatedinpracticeasadevicereadyforone-timeprogramming,whileinEasanorgan\nthat grows and changes throughout the lifespan (Fields, 2010; Dawkins, 2004).\n13. Ten thousand hours is the amount of time of deliberate practice required for reaching an expert level of per-\nformance (Ericsson, 2004; Gladwell, 2008) and a teacher needs this much deliberate practice to become a good\nteacher in E.\nThe explanation of number 7 in the Table says that a sketch of specifications for system E, congruent with the\ndirection of development of the contemporary world, has already been drawn by Drucker (1993). During Drucker’s\nnearly century-long life he actively studied the practice of management processes involved in the transition of the\nmost-developed countries from domination of a manual work force through instruction to domination of a workforce\ncharacterized by mental work based on values, knowledge and skills. Specifications for the emerging system E along\nwith predictable mechanisms of creating, principles of measuring (different from the ones applied in e), and methods\nof improving E by new generations until e is almost completely eliminated (probably still in the 21st century), form\na list of challenges for ergonomic engineers. These will be engineers who out of respect for human factors are willing\nto engage in redesigning education for the world to have a future.\nSuppose that inhabitants of the most-advanced countries cease to accept systems of type e and learn in them less\nand less effectively, while the systems of type e enriched with new knowledge and technology continue to be very\neffective in developing countries. A question arises: Is not a change from e to E in the leading countries a necessary\ncondition for their continued fulfillment of this role?\nV. ENGINEERING BY KIDS\nIt is clear from our outline that the task of changing education is not to be completed quickly, even if the change\nis a necessary condition for continuation of development of democratic social systems. The cohorts of ergonomic\nengineers will have to engage in such tasks over many generations. To educate the required generations of capable\nengineers, one has to involve candidates as early as when they are children so that they will later have a chance to\nexcel over time in systemic handling of extremely complex processes of learning. If people continue to apply systems\noftype e to educate engineers,there is no chancethat the alumni willdevelopthe new systemE.Inorderto educate\nengineers who will possess the needed values, knowledge and skills one has to switch from teaching kids according to\nthe principles of engineering for kids (look, kids, you ought to do this or that) to the principles of engineering by\nkids (look, kids, you know the problem you face, design a solution).\nAn illustration of the paradigm shift from e to E is provided by the following which incorporates principles of the\nscouting movement. There is a situation at a scouting camp where one group of scouts is separated from another\nby a river. They conceive of a bridge and get it built. Instead of imprinting minds in a classroom for engineers,\nknowledgeableandskillfulcoacheshelpstudentsdesignandbuildabridgeanddefactosomeofthembecomeseriously\ninterested in engineering. In contrast, a teacher in a classroom could explain to students who sit at their desks how\ncarpentersworkonabridge. Thisexampledoesnotneedfurtherexplanationinordertocatchtheattentionofserious\nhuman factor thinkers whose intention is to make the human learning as ergonomic as it can be.\nThere exists a great deal of information about the principles and functioning of youth organizations that provide\nmembers with the values, knowledge and skills they need. Poland has a particularly rich tradition in this respect\nbecause of the long nationalstruggle for freedom. Unfortunately, the available sourcesare practically solely available\nin Polish. For completeness, two examples are Janowski (2010) and Kamin´ski (2013). In addition, contemporary\nPolish examples of the role that scouting experience can play in producing leaders of great merit include Michal\nKulesza, (Wikipedia, 2014) who engaged in scouting in his youth and later designed the democratic government\nsystem for Poland after Solidarity took power from communists. An example from the US is provided by Frances\nHesselbein(Hesselbein,2011). SheledtheGirlScoutsoftheUSandhelpedmembersoftheAmericanarmyleadership\nunderstand the principles of education needed for soldiers and officers.\nOne should also note the great need for the education of managers in values, knowledge and skills stressed by\nJoseph Maciariello (Maciariello and Linkletter, 2011). This concerns not only the management of engineering but\nquite generally high level management in all types of organizations that comprise society. Maciariello stressed the10\nlack of required education for managers as the key reason for recent world crises. The references provided in this\nsectionsubstantiatealinkbetweentheneedforErgonomicEducationandthewell-beingofsocietyonalargescalethat\nactuallyoriginatesinhowkidsareeducated,withscoutingprovidingexamples. Theseexamplesarealsosupportedby\nthe dialog between Druckerand Albert Shanker, the late president of the American Federation of Teachers(Drucker,\n1990, pp. 132-138).\nThe ergonomicprinciple of designing the environment to fit the user instead of being content with forcing the user\nto fit the environment provides engineers and engineering education with the opportunity to engage with the big\nE paradigm. These engineers can become leaders of the new paradigm. The ergonomic perspective of the human\ncondition is here viewed as capable of becoming a basis for the new educational design, provided that the engineers:\n(1) recognize the principles of productive learning; (2) adhere to the spirit of performance defined by Peter Drucker;\n(3) incorporate Drucker’s principles of management in organizing their new system; and (4) manage the practice of\nparental support for teacher initiatives in building the new system of engineering by kids. Children and teachers,\nwith support of parents, learn the principles of ergonomic engineering through and in collaboration with qualified\nengineers. They experience engineering as a vital element of a rational approach to the human condition in a highly\ndeveloped society. The reason for calling this section Engineering by Kids, is that the students are self-motivated to\nlearn,arecarefully informedby their coachesaboutthe progressthey make,and arehelped by coachesindiscovering\nthat they need to learn more.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nTheparadigmshiftfrometoEforeducationisbasedonthehistoryofscience,technologyandsociety(e.g.,Hughes,\n1983; Smith, 2009) and the millions of years of biological development supporting the current learning abilities of\nhumans (e.g., Dawkins, 2004; Fields, 2010). The new paradigm, big E, brings the current condition of educational\nchaos to a transition and transformation that recognizes the human condition of wanting to learn.\nErgonomic Education focuses on student strengths not weaknesses, it emphasizes the context of learning and not\na fixed curriculum, it is not constrained by age-graded classes, and it envisions a self-correcting system for life-long\nlearning. In Ergonomic Education the disciplines are no longer dictated to students but are discovered, practiced\nand developed by each new generation of students as they develop their strengths both as individuals and as part\nof a team. It incorporates the concept of productive learning (Glazek and Sarason, 2006) and Drucker’s (Drucker\nand Maciariello, 2008) principles of the spirit of performance and continuity, embodied in the pattern of practice\nin Engineering by Kids. It is a system that takes a new approach to education by engaging students of any age in\nbuilding their learning habits through what they want to learn and helping them to learn to benefit from deliberate\npractice (Ericsson, 2004) as they enter and develop the world of values, knowledge and skills.\nTheErgonomicEducationparadigmshiftstoeducationbasedoncoachingstudentsashumanbeingswhoarehungry\nforproductive learningthroughouttheirlives fromtheir veryearliestdays. Allstudents, regardlessofage,arehelped\nto learn in a system formed by competent educators operating within a new organizational structure. Ergonomic\nengineersareuniquely qualifiedfordesigningandbuildingsuchafunctioningsystemofbigEandcontinuingtomake\nadjustments to improve the system to meet the individual learning needs of students and groups of students as they\nstrive to learn new knowledge and develop social skills.\nIn addition to the direct impact of e to E on education, we propose that this is the path to Drucker’s (1993)\nconceptofcontinuityinaglobalsocietyoforganizationswherecontinuingeconomicgrowth,world-widestability,and\ndemocratic leadershipcan flourish. This is a much more desirable situation than exists in societies which continue to\nuse the Comenian “printing minds” education system to either direct or even limit the opportunities for its citizens\nto learn. The paradigm of Ergonomic Education, in which the foundations of knowledge, skills of management, and\nengineering must be combined to build a post-Comenian educational system, appears to be a necessarycondition for\nsuccessful leadership of advanced democratic societies in the world.\nAcknowledgement: This paper is the result of a long collaboration between the authors and the late Kenneth\nG.

With the advent of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) like ChatGPT, we've transitioned into a new era of lively and engaging learning\nexperiences. Yet, our journey propels us further towards the new frontier of Large Multimodal\nModels (LMMs). These models, proficient in handling text, images, and audio, promise to deliver\nenriched, meaningful learning environments. The evolution envisages a landscape where AI\nblends seamlessly into our educational endeavors, potentially giving rise to proficient AI\nassistants that augment our digital interactions (Yang et al., 2023).\nThe education sector finds itself at a critical turning point, with growing uncertainty as learners\nwill increasingly demand personalized, interactive learning experiences enabled by AI. The\nabsence of a relevant framework for seamlessly integrating these emerging technologies into\nthe broader educational processes and systems poses a challenge. This paper unfolds a\nunifying vision and charts a purposeful path forward to navigate the sense of escalating unease\nin the field of education, aiming to guide the integration of these emerging technologies into\nteaching and learning environments.\nThe Generative Education (GenEd) Framework, introduced in this paper, offers a practical path\nforward by blending traditional instructional methods with AI to create new types of AI-Blended\nLearning solutions and experiences. The GenEd Framework provides a structured approach for\nintegrating AI in education, cultivating cooperative relationships between educators and AI, and\nguiding the necessary policy, infrastructure, and mindset changes to successfully navigate this\ntechnological transition. At its core, the GenEd Framework proposes AI-Learning Companions,\ntransitioning AI from tools to collaborative partners in personalized learning. This framework\nsees every learning interaction, content, and material as valuable training data for AI models,\ncombined with a method called Reinforcement Learning using Human Feedback (RLHF) which\ncontinuously improves the models' capabilities over time. In the GenEd Framework this\nfeedback is education-centric, obtained from interactions among learners, educators, and AI.\nThis specialized feedback, intricately tied to educational outcomes, enhances the AI models'\nlearning efficacy.\nCentral to the GenEd Framework is establishing cooperative relationships between educators\nand AI. In this model, many educators will transition away from more traditional roles to become\nAI-Enhanced Mentors, providing insights that improve AI systems while still making vital\ncontributions to the learners. This change envisions an educational setting where AI assists and\naugments, rather than replaces, human educators, creating a collaborative environment that\nsignificantly advances both access to and quality of education.\nTo drive this vision forward, we introduce Harmony, a practical product concept aimed at\nnurturing human connections in the AI-enhanced education world. Harmony represents an initial\nstep towards realizing the GenEd Framework vision, demonstrating the harmonious potential of\nhuman and AI collaboration to create an effective and personalized learning environment.\n3This paper not only clarifies the GenEd Framework but also delves into the necessary changes\nin policy, infrastructure, and mindset needed to realize this vision. It unveils promising business\nopportunities ready to propel EdTech innovation and role redefinition within the education sector.\nMoreover, it extends the discussion to envision the significant impact and endless potential that\nfuture AI advancements, including LMMs, could have in reshaping the educational paradigm. In\ndoing so, it underscores the need for proactive adaptation in the face of AI's ongoing evolution.\nFurthermore, this narrative explores the practical application and validation of the GenEd\nFramework's core principles, indicating a future of education that’s not merely personalized but\nelevated by the constructive interplay of AI and human creativity.\nBackground\nThe Evolution of AI in Education Research\nThe path of blending artificial intelligence with education (AIEd) has seen a remarkable\nevolution. It began as early as the 1960s and 1970s with pioneering Intelligent Tutoring Systems\n(ITS) and Computer-Assisted Instruction systems. As we moved into the 1980s and 1990s, the\nfield became more established with significant milestones like the launch of the International\nJournal of Artificial Intelligence in Education in 1989 and the creation of the International AI in\nEducation Society (IAIED) in 1993. Over the last quarter-century, the focus has largely been on\ncreating one-on-one tutoring systems, aiming to solve a challenge known as the \"two-sigma\nproblem,\" which is further discussed in the next subsection (Bloom, 1984).\nRecent reflections on AI in education research from 1993 onwards have shed light on a wide\nrange of focus areas. These range from instructional design and learning sciences to creating\npractical classroom tools and technological development. Technologies like Automated\nAssessment Systems, Adaptive Learning Platforms, and Multimodal Learning Analytics have\nplayed a crucial role in the past and continue to shape the educational landscape.\nBridging the Two-Sigma Problem through AI-Blended Learning\nThe \"Two-Sigma Problem,\" pinpointed by Benjamin Bloom, highlights a significant performance\ndifference between students receiving one-on-one tutoring and those in traditional classroom\nsettings. The GenEd Framework aims to bridge this gap through an AI-Blended Learning\napproach. By transitioning educators to AI-Enhanced Mentoring roles and introducing\nAI-Learning Companions, the framework seeks to provide personalized attention, similar to\none-on-one tutoring, at a larger scale. This modern approach, fueled by advancements in AI like\nLLMs and LMMs, aims to address the Two-Sigma problem, thus aligning historical educational\ngoals with modern AI-enabled possibilities.\nThe Dawn of Large Multimodal Models in Education\nThe arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT initiated an exciting yet\ncontroversial chapter in the education sector, showcasing the profound capabilities of AI.\n4However, the exploration into AI-enhanced education is just beginning with LLMs as the initial\nstep. The following wave promises to be so significant that it might fundamentally disrupt the\nentire idea and role of education in our lives. LLMs, mainly designed for text, fall short in\ncapturing the full essence of human learning, which involves visual, auditory, and hands-on\nexperiences.\nSoon arriving are Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), a true game-changer not only for education\nbut also set to cause dramatic changes across almost all industries. LMMs have the unique\nability to process diverse types of data like text, images, videos, and speech all at once, creating\na unified understanding (Yang et al., 2023). This approach will potentially allow LMMs to\nthoroughly understand a wide range of inputs, providing responsive and personalized learning\nsupport.\nWhat really sets LMMs apart is their potential expertise in computer vision, which extends\nbeyond mere object recognition to a deeper understanding of human emotions and interactions.\nThey can not only understand the digital world but also glimpse into our physical world through\nvideo inputs, potentially reading a learner's emotional state, offering reassurance and support\nduring challenging tasks. This capability opens up a realm where AI can provide not only\nintellectual but emotional support, tailoring responses and guidance based on a learner's current\nemotional state and learning pace. This transformation opens up new dimensions of learning,\nmarking a significant leap in the educational landscape.\nThe ability of LMMs to understand our physical spaces through computer vision fits perfectly\nwith spatial computing, shown by platforms like Apple's Vision Pro, opening new doors in\neducation. Spatial computing blends the physical and digital worlds, turning any place into an\nintelligent classroom enhanced by AI instruction. The pairing of LMMs' computer vision with\nspatial computing's ability to interact with the physical world is set to fundamentally reshape\neducation, merging the digital and physical realms in a unified learning environment.\nFor example, imagine an art history class studying Rembrandt where students enter a vivid 3D\nsimulation of his world enabled by LMMs and spatial computing. The LMM tailors each student's\nperspective - a budding young artist may see Rembrandt incorporating their original artwork into\na painting while discussing techniques and giving feedback. As the student explores a virtual\nrecreation of Rembrandt's studio, they gain first-hand advice from the master artist on how to\nimprove their skills. This mentoring from a personalized Rembrandt avatar, made possible by\nthe LMM, provides invaluable insight that ignites the student's passion for painting. Immersing\nstudents in a tailored Rembrandt narrative promotes deeper connections with his art and life.\nThis demonstrates how LMMs and spatial computing could redefine art education by\nconstructing personalized simulated worlds that boost engagement, understanding, and\ninspiration.\nThis shift calls for strategic adaptation, and the GenEd Framework provides a vital roadmap.\nGenEd emphasizes reskilling educators, empowering them to provide diverse, high-quality\ntraining data to unlock the full potential of LMMs as personalized learning companions. This\ncollaborative partnership between educators and LMMs aims to elevate education to new\nheights. By proactively embracing this transformation, education can harness the transformative\n5capabilities of LMMs and spatial computing, catalyzing a future where learning breaks physical\nboundaries and is continuously enriched through human-AI collaboration.\nThe Generative Education (GenEd) Framework\nThe emergence of advanced AI technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large\nMultimodal Models (LMMs) brings a transformative moment in education. The GenEd\nFramework lays out a practical roadmap to harness AI's potential to enhance, not replace, the\ncontributions of education professionals. The ultimate goal is to create a collaborative\nenvironment involving not just educators and AI companions, but also institutions, governments,\nindustries, and more, all working in harmony to enrich the learning experience. This collective\nendeavor aims to redefine education, positioning it at the crossroads of human expertise and\ncutting-edge AI technology. (see figure below)\nFigure 1.

        "content": "Enhancing science instruction in the elementary schools\nWalk into an elementary school classroom and watch the excitement of children learning\nscience. Contrast this experience with that of a physics professor standing in front of a sea of\nfirst-year students in an introductory college physics course. The first group of students is often\nenthusiastic about the subject matter and cares about what the teacher is saying. In contrast, the\nsecond group consists mostly of students trying to expend the minimum effort needed to achieve\nthe maximum possible grade. The college students are often frustrated by the work required and\nresentful of teachers who do not recognize that a high grade is their principal goal.\nWhat causes the enthusiasm of the first group to dwindle? Is this change an inevitable\nconsequence of adolescence? Is it a result of bad teaching? Has this loss of interest been present\nat all times and places, or is it a recent phenomenon that mainly occurs at big state colleges and\nuniversities? Is it exacerbated by grade inflation and/or over-emphasis on grades? Is the problem\nan ironic consequence of society’s concern about quality teaching, leading to student evaluations\nand “performance standards,” which have had counterproductive effects (pandering, grade\ninflation, teaching-to-the-test)? Is it worse for physics, or science in general, than other\ndisciplines? These are difficult questions that lack simple answers.\nProblems with student interest and achievement in American science education have been\nrecognized for a long time. One of us (Cole) was in high school when Sputnik was launched,\nprecipitating hand-wringing concern about U.S. science education, which resulted in some\nchanges in the science curriculum and support. Subsequently, these problems have not gone\naway. For example, recent U.S. student performance in international mathematics and science\ncompetitions has been disappointing. The most recent (1999) TIMSS-R comparative study of\neighth grade students’ understanding of math and science found that the average performance of\nstudents in the U.S. is below the average of students in the 23 countries participating in this\nassessment.1 The overall performance of U.S. students was below that of students from two\nsimilar immigrant countries, Australia and Canada, but about the same as students in Great\nBritain. Most importantly, our students’ average performance on these science and mathematics\nexams declines (relative to students elsewhere) with grade level. To deal with this problem is a\nserious concern. A National Academy of Sciences report2 affirms that “The challenge [to improve\nscience education] extends to everyone within the system. Efforts will be time-consuming,\nexpensive, and sometimes uncomfortable. They will also be exhilarating and deeply rewarding.\nThere is no more important task before us as a nation.” In particular, this report encourages “…\nscientists and engineers to work with school personnel to initiate and sustain the improvement of\nschool science programs.”3\nWhat can we, as individuals, do? In the following, we discuss some recent collaborative\nactivities undertaken by the two of us, a physicist and a science teacher educator, aimed at\nenhancing elementary school science teaching and learning. These activities exemplify the kinds\nof projects that might be useful when synergistic working relationships are established.4\nOur work is an extension of an ongoing partnership between Penn State University and\nthe State College Area School District.5 Our collaboration, which we nicknamed the “flight\nteam,” consists of two elementary teachers, a curriculum support teacher, a volunteer pilot from\nUS Airways, and the two of us. Our goal is to enhance the Air and Aviation unit, which is part of\nthe 3rd and 4th grade curriculum in our local schools. We met regularly during the spring of 2001\nand engaged in extensive discussions, aimed at clarifying concepts involved in flight and crafting\nopportunities for children to participate in elements of scientific inquiry. The emphasis on\nmeaningful science learning and scientific inquiry is fundamental to contemporary reform efforts\nin science education.6\nOur discussions were a learning experience for all of us. The emphasis on flight concepts\nfit well with our focus on teaching science as inquiry. Given that the physical principles\ngoverning our world are often counterintuitive, thinking about them raises interesting, testablequestions. To demonstrate the concept of lift and its application to flight, the teachers on our team\nsuggested that a wind tunnel would be a valuable demonstration device. A very talented graduate\nstudent in physics at Penn State, John Huckans, succeeded in building a wind tunnel at a modest\ncost. The students construct airfoils of their own design and test them in the wind tunnel. They\ncan then make changes to their design based on their observations during the initial trials.7 This\nproject has provoked much discussion among the participants, which now includes two\nundergraduate students, a physics major and a prospective science teacher, and we have had\nongoing debates about the importance of the Bernoulli force in really keeping planes in the air.\nTwo other projects are underway. One is the production of a video aimed at explaining\nflight principles and practice to students. Video clips from the longer instructional video will be\navailable on the project web site, <http://www.ed.psu.edu/pds>. The second project is the\ndevelopment of an online tool, Faculty Forum. The Faculty Forum began as a database of unit-\nrelated web sites specific to the local elementary school curriculum. Web sites are added to the\ndatabase by teachers who have reviewed them and/or have used them to enhance the teaching of\nparticular units. Teaching tips and other information are included. Although this resource was\noriginally targeted at science units that lack useful resources, it has been extended to include web\nsites for other aspects of the elementary curriculum. In addition, two components have been\nadded to the Faculty Forum – a library of Technology Enhanced Lessons and an electronic\nbulletin board for teachers to discuss issues and share ideas.\nNot only have these projects reached local teachers and their children, but they are also\ninfluencing the development of the next generation of teachers. The science educator on the flight\nteam, Zembal-Saul, has modified her science methods course for elementary education majors to\ninclude model lessons adapted from the enhancements to the Air and Aviation unit. Prospective\nteachers experience first-hand what it is like to interact with phenomena associated with flight,\nask testable questions, collect data, examine their data for patterns, and construct evidence-based\nexplanations. In other words, they experience what it is like to learn science concepts by engaging\nin scientific inquiry, which is in stark contrast to the ways in which they report having learned\nscience previously. Ultimately, the prospective teachers draw upon what they have learned about\nsupporting students’ meaningful science learning and scientific inquiry to design and teach\ninquiry-based science lessons to children.\nFrom this process, the physicist on the flight team, Cole, has learned much about the\nphysics of flight; more importantly, he has been reminded of the difficulty of learning new\nconcepts and jettisoning old ones. A most rewarding aspect of this activity has been the\nopportunity to meet and learn from other science educators about their challenges, which are\nfrequently different and more difficult than those encountered in teaching a university physics\ncourse.\nBy our activities we and others have made small steps toward addressing the problems of\nscience education mentioned at the beginning of this editorial. There are many components of this\nprocess: making science teachers feel comfortable with and enthusiastic about science is one in\nwhich we are particularly involved. No less important is the need to revise college science\ncourses, which is the most direct way that physics faculty can improve the appreciation and\nunderstanding of science.8\nMilton W.

Citations are now widely accepted as a measurement of recognition. The number\nof citations that an article received measures its impact on a specific field (Lai, Darius, & Lerut,\n2012). Citation analysis is one of the most important tools to evaluate research performance\n(Bornmann, Schier, Marx, & Daniel, 2012). Citation indicator is important for scientists and\nuniversities in all over the world (Farhadi, Salehi, Yunus, Aghaei Chadegani, Farhadi, Fooladi, &\nAle Ebrahim, 2013).\nBodin (2012) defines physics education research as research about how we learn, teach,\nunderstand, and use physics. Physics Education Research (PER) is the driving force to the way\nintroductory physics is being taught in secondary schools, colleges, and universities (Andre´e\nTiberghien, Jossem, & Barojas, 1998; Yeo & Treagust, 2000). Physics education research tends to\nfocus on problems associated with the teaching of physics (Heron & Meltzer, 2005). Physics\neducation research is an interdisciplinary research area and combines education research that is\ninfluenced by social studies, psychology, and physics that is a traditional academic subject.\nTherefore physics education can be approached in many ways depending on the applications\n(Bodin, 2012). Physic educations included a wide range of studies from research on general culture\n(Kapitsa, 1982), ‘‘hands-on’’ exhibits (Read, 1989), gender issues (Stewart, 1998), classroom-\nbased innovation (Tobias, 2000), multimedia (Wagner, Altherr, Eckert, & Jodl, 2003), IT-based\n(Akizo, 2004), e-Learning (Stoeva & Cvetkov, 2005), language (Michinel, 2006), used images\n(Bulbul, 2007), computational problem solving (Landau, 2007), gesture analysis (Scherr, 2008),\nthe use of conceptual diagrams (Martins, Verdeaux, & de Sousa, 2009), quality (Aneta, 2010), 3D\nVirtual Laboratory (Jeong, Park, Kim, Oh, & Yoo, 2011), modeling (Uhden, Karam, Pietrocola,\n& Pospiech, 2012), and concept maps (Martinez, Perez, Suero, & Pardo, 2013) to mathematical\nmodels (Huang & Fang, 2013).\nA major theme at several national and international conferences has been selected on physics\neducation research (McDermott & Redish, 1999). Vollmer (2003) has done a research among 22\nEuropean countries experts on physics education research and found that interest in physics\neducation has increased. In particular, the last two decades have seen the growth of an international\ncommunity engaged in research in physics education (McDermott & Redish, 1999). There are\nseveral groups that conduct research in physics education and there is a substantial literature\n(McDermott, 2001). Most early physics education research focused on student ability to apply the\nconcepts covered in typical introductory university physics courses (Heron & Meltzer, 2005; van\nAalst, 2000).\nIn summary, limited bibliometrics study have been investigated on the publication patterns in the\neducation, such as (Cheng, Wang, Morch, Chen, Kinshuk, & Spector, 2014; Chiang, Kuo, & Yang,\n2010; Gomez-Garcia, Ramiro, Ariza, & Granados, 2012; Marshakova-Shaikevich, 2005;\nPiotrowski, 2013). Additionally, two of them concentrate on physics education (Anduckia, Gomez,\n& Gomez, 2000; Jacobs & Ingwersen, 2000) which were published more than a decade ago. So, a\ncomprehensive and up-to-date bibliometrics study on Physics education is needed. This paper\nreports on the used a bibliometric approach to, analyze the productivity and development of\npublications on the subject category of Physics Education in the period 1980–2013.\n2Post print version of: S. M. Jamali, A. N. Md Zain, M. A. Samsudin, and N. Ale Ebrahim, “Publication Trends in Physics Education:\nA Bibliometric study,” Journal of Educational Research vol. 35, pp. 19-36, 2015. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.801889\nMaterials and methods\nMost bibliometrics studies have used Web of Science (WoS) to obtain citation data (Bakri &\nWillett, 2011). Since WoS is the oldest citation database, it has strong coverage with bibliometrics\ndata which goes back to 1900 (Aghaei Chadegani, Salehi, Yunus, Farhadi, Fooladi, Farhadi, &\nAle Ebrahim, 2013). The Web of Sciences Core Collection (as a prat of WoS) is a leading database\nwith high quality and multidisciplinary research information, by the subscribed from the Institute\nof Scientific Information (ISI), also known as Thomson Reuters.\nTo draw our sample and following prior literature, we first conducted a comprehensive search to\ncollect the data from WoS database. This database provides the information to examine the\npublication trends in Physics Education since 1980 until 25th December 2013. Science Citation\nIndex Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index and Arts & Humanities Citation Index, were\nsearched for “Physics Education*” (Physics Education OR Physics Educational and etc.) in the\ntopic (3,770 papers). The search then refined by WoS category “Education Educational Research”\n(1,360 papers). For each paper, all bibliometric data, especially the number of references and the\nnumber of times the paper was cited during the interval between the year of publication and the\nyear 2013, were collected.\nIn order to find the top cited papers in the field of Physics Education, citations analysis is used.\nCitation statistics produced by shorter than three years’ time frame may not be sufficiently stable\n(Adams, 2005; UZUN, 2006) because papers appearing in the Web of Science databases over the\nlast few years have not had enough time to accumulate a stable number of citations (Webster,\nJonason, & Schember, 2009). Therefore, the time span limited to 1980 until 25 December 2010,\nyielding a subsample of 813 publications (60% of the original sample). Publications with zero\ncitation were removed. After drawing the final sample, we designed our measurement of the\nnumber of citations that studies in our sample had received. The key issue in measuring the\ncitations is that the time elapsed since publication significantly impacts the number of citations\nthat articles receive (Eshraghi, Osman, Gholizadeh, Ali, & Shadgan, 2013). To avoid this bias, we\ndesigned and calculated a citation index for each study as the average number of citations per year.\nThen, we ranked the studies in our sample based on this index to identify top 10 papers with highest\ncitation per year.\nIn order to answer the question “What do Physics education scientists concentrate in their\npublications?”, the Keyword Plus® and author keywords were extracted from 1360 papers between\n1980–2013. Author Keyword are words or phrases provided by the author to justly provide idea\nof the article while Keywords Plus® are words or phrases that frequently appear in the titles of an\narticle's references, but do not necessarily appear in the title of the article itself. Keywords Plus®,\nretrieved from the Thomson Reuters auto indexing system, may be present for articles that have\nno author keywords, or may include important terms not listed among the title, abstract, or author\nkeywords (Ale Ebrahim, 2013).\n3Post print version of: S.

Information produced by bibliometric studies can be exploited as\na source to evaluate the performance of sub-fields in a research domain and to adjust science\npolicies with regard to funding allocations and comparing scientific input and output (Debackere\n& Glanzel, 2004).\nAnalysis of author keywords and Keyword Plus®\nThe Keywords Plus® analyses for data collected from 1980-2013 were extracted and the\npercentage range were computed (Table 1). Physics was largely used as the Keywords Plus® (n =\n4562) regardless of year category. Among the top 20 Keywords Plus® (n=1726, 37.83% of total),\ntwo were used in the titles of the published papers. The words that emerged to be new were the\nKNOWLEDGE, SCIENCE-EDUCATION, and ACHIEVEMENT. The ACHIEVEMENT,\nCONCEPTUAL CHANGE, MODEL(S), and INSTRUCTION seemed to be also a keyword that\nhas increased quite a bit. The table indicates that all the importance of Keywords Plus® for future\nresearch.\nTable 1 Top 20 Keywords Plus®\nNO.

Top 20 author keywords\n(589, 14.86% of total) are extracted from 3963 Author Keywords. Consequently, a comparison\nbetween Top ten Keywords Plus® and Author Keyword is illustrated in Table 3. There is a\nconsiderable difference in the similarity of the Author Keyword and Keywords Plus®. Author\nKeywords are keywords that are given by the author for each article. On the other hand, the\nKeywords Plus® is keyword given by the Web of Science for each article. Table 3 lays out the top\nten Keywords Plus® and Author Keywords with the frequency in the published article and its rank\nin the Keywords Plus®. Out of the top ten author keyword only 50% are in the top ten Keywords\nPlus®.

The Keywords Plus® looking backward and measure the high frequency phrases\nin the title of published papers, while the author keyword represent author's current ideas about the\npaper. So, the order of the authors’ keywords which are Physics education, Physics, Science\neducation, Physics education research, Education, Gender, Conceptual change, Misconceptions,\nand Secondary education are guidelines for the future research topics.\nTable 2 Top 20 Keywords\nNo. Keywords Frequency Percentage of Total\n1 Physics education 118 2.98%\n2 Physics 85 2.14%\n3 Science education 79 1.99%\n4 Physics Education research 47 1.19%\n5 Education 31 0.78%\n6 Gender 26 0.66%\n7 Conceptual change 25 0.63%\n8 Misconceptions 18 0.45%\n9 Secondary education 18 0.45%\n10 Problem solving 17 0.43%\n11 Learning 14 0.35%\n12 Chemistry 13 0.33%\n13 Higher education 13 0.33%\n14 Teacher education 13 0.33%\n15 Teaching 13 0.33%\n16 Technology 13 0.33%\n17 Women in physics 12 0.30%\n18 Constructivism 12 0.30%\n19 Science 11 0.28%\n20 Simulations 11 0.28%\n5Post print version of: S.

The top-ranking authors, articles, and publishing journals were\nintroduced and analyzed, and were ranked by different indexes. The distribution of publications\nand the trend of publications over the years displayed an increasing trend of publication and\nrevealed the USA as the highest performing country in terms of publishing articles on the subject\nof Physics Education. In addition, the study prove that the frequency of publications in a journal\ndo not guarantee the quality of the papers which reflected by citations per year. For instance,\naccording to the number of publications journal of “ENERGY EDUCATION SCIENCE AND\nTECHNOLOGY PART B-SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL STUDIES” ranked 34. However,\nthree highly cited papers with 81, 32, 27.5 citations per year, published in the journal. As the\nresearch on the Physics Education field grow in interest, bibliometric analysis would assist\nresearchers in identifying key elements and characterization of the Physics Education literature\nresearch. In the light of that, more efforts should be channeled in bibliometric studies in all fields.\nReferences\nAdams, J. (2005). Early citation counts correlate with accumulated impact.
